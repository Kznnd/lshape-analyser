# Note
**We have developed the MATLAB version which use the appdesigner to develop. One can obtain more detail in the folder  _MATLAB/_ . We now are developing the corresponding tool used C++. Stay tuned. **

# Introduction
This project will share a tool for quantitatively analyzing the local shape of animals, mainly used for quantitatively evaluating their body condition scores(BCS). The workflow of our tool can be seen in the following figure.
