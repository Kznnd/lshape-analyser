### Introduction
This project will share a tool for quantitatively analyzing the local shape of animals, mainly used for quantitatively evaluating their body condition scores(BCS).  **The dataset used in this study, along with the code implementation, will be made publicly available following the publication of our paper.** The workflow of our tool can be seen in the following figure.

Some intermediate results can be viewed in the  **‘dataset’**  folder.  
  
We have developed the MATLAB version which use the appdesigner to develop. One can obtain more detail in the folder  _MATLAB/_ . The source code will be available after the publication of our paper.  

### Note
**We now are developing the corresponding tool used C++. Stay tuned.**
